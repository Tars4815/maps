# **Concert tour maps** 🎧🌎🌍🌏

Playing with Python is a great fun, especially when some good music is playing on background... So, why not trying to make animated maps of global tours of favorite singers?

## **Inspiration** 💡
The idea for this funny exercise came when preparing a map submission for the **30 Day Map Challenge**. The [original map of *The Formation World Tour* by Beyoncé](https://github.com/Tars4815/30DayMapChallenge#day-28-the-earth-is-not-flat) was realised using QGIS and working on data from Wikipedia, Wikidata and Natural Earth.

Along my Python learning journey, the desire to replicate the exercise in a more dynamic and automated way met the willingness to experiment with new libraries... and that's it!
